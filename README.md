# Evolution Simulation

 •  Designed and implemented a simulation modeling the evolution of 200 predators and 400 prey in a dynamic
 ecosystem.
 
 •  Crafted efficient Genetic Algorithm components, including selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation
 functions, to simulate genetic evolution accurately. The predators Dominate within 10 Generations.
 
 •  Created interactive visual elements using Pygame, enhancing user engagement
